	Note:	I got the camera transition controls swapped, but it doesn't really
		make a difference anyway, so I left it as is.

R - Reset the camera to its starting orientation and position
- (Minus) - Remove the last game object from the PCSTree and store it.
= (Equals) - If you have a game object stored, add it to the front of the PCSTree and "unstore" it
DELETE - Permanently delete the object you have stored.

M - Add a new camera with the starting position and orientation and switch to it.
, (Comma) - Create a new camera with an experimental "orthogonal" projection matrix.
	Note:	The orthogonal camera was something I experimented with, but didn't
		have time to finish. It doesn't work right, but feel free to check it
		out if you want--it's trippy. You can delete it like a normal camera.
